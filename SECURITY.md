# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Statement

Starnus takes the security of our software products and services seriously. This document outlines our security practices and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## üîí Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | ‚úÖ Yes            |
| < 1.0   | ‚ùå No             |

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly:

### How to Report
1. **Email**: Send details to `security@starnus.com`
2. **Include**: 
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### What to Expect
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution Timeline**: Varies by severity
- **Credit**: Public acknowledgment (if desired)

### Please Do NOT
- Open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
- Exploit the vulnerability beyond proof of concept
- Access or modify data belonging to others

## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Environment Security
```bash
# Use environment variables for sensitive data
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"  # Never hardcode in scripts

# Secure your .env file
chmod 600 .env
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

#### Browser Security
- **Profile Isolation**: Use dedicated Chrome profiles for automation
- **Session Management**: Log out of sensitive accounts before automation
- **Network Security**: Ensure secure network connections (avoid public WiFi)

#### Data Protection
- **Local Storage**: Keep all data processing local to your machine
- **Regular Cleanup**: Remove temporary files and logs containing sensitive data
- **Backup Security**: Encrypt backups containing LinkedIn data

### For Developers

#### Code Security
```python
# Good: Use environment variables
api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

# Bad: Hardcoded secrets
api_key = "sk-1234567890abcdef"  # Never do this!
```

#### Dependencies
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use `pip-audit` to check for known vulnerabilities
- Pin dependency versions in production

## ‚ö†Ô∏è LinkedIn-Specific Security Considerations

### Authentication
- **Never store LinkedIn passwords** in code or config files
- **Use existing browser sessions** to maintain authentic authentication
- **Respect session timeouts** and re-authenticate as needed

### Rate Limiting
- **Implement delays** between requests to avoid triggering rate limits
- **Monitor for HTTP 429** responses and back off appropriately
- **Use reasonable concurrency** levels (recommend: 1 concurrent request)

### Data Handling
- **Minimize data collection** to only what's necessary
- **Respect privacy settings** of LinkedIn profiles
- **Delete temporary data** after processing
- **Comply with GDPR/CCPA** if applicable

## üîç Automated Security Measures

### Dependency Scanning
```bash
# Run security audit before deployment
pip install pip-audit
pip-audit

# Check for outdated dependencies
pip list --outdated
```

### Code Analysis
```bash
# Static analysis for security issues
pip install bandit
bandit -r . -f json -o bandit-report.json
```

### Environment Validation
```python
# Validate environment setup
def validate_environment():
    required_vars = ['OPENAI_API_KEY']
    missing = [var for var in required_vars if not os.getenv(var)]
    if missing:
        raise ValueError(f"Missing required environment variables: {missing}")
```

## üö´ Known Security Limitations

### Browser Automation Risks
- **Detection**: LinkedIn may detect automated behavior
- **Account Restrictions**: Risk of temporary or permanent account limitations
- **Data Exposure**: Browser debugging mode exposes additional attack surface

### API Security
- **Rate Limits**: OpenAI API usage may be monitored
- **Data Transmission**: API calls contain LinkedIn data
- **Cost Controls**: Implement usage limits to prevent unexpected charges

## üìù Security Checklist for Deployment

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All secrets moved to environment variables
- [ ] Dependencies updated and audited
- [ ] .gitignore includes sensitive file patterns
- [ ] Code reviewed for hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Error handling doesn't expose sensitive data

### Production Environment
- [ ] Dedicated Chrome profile for automation
- [ ] Secure network connection
- [ ] Monitoring for unusual API usage
- [ ] Regular security updates applied
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested

### LinkedIn Compliance
- [ ] Read and understood LinkedIn Terms of Service
- [ ] Implemented appropriate delays and rate limiting
- [ ] Only accessing permitted data
- [ ] Respecting user privacy settings
- [ ] Have legal review if using for business purposes

## üÜò Incident Response

If you suspect a security incident:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Stop the automation immediately
   - Disconnect from networks if needed
   - Document what happened

2. **Assessment**:
   - Determine scope of potential data exposure
   - Check for unauthorized access or modifications
   - Review logs for suspicious activity

3. **Reporting**:
   - Contact Starnus security team
   - Report to LinkedIn if their data was involved
   - Notify affected users if personal data was compromised
